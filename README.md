# WEBProject
- A semester task project with php. Website for teachers where they can see their students, students' information and grades. Teacher can send an email to student or student's parent.

- I did this project with my groupmate: 

🍃 His part: Whole admin part ~ admin page design, crud on admin panel.
      
🍰 My part: The rest part ~ all another pages, email system, authorization, registration, password recovering.
